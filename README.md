# Raggle

Raggle is a command-line interface (CLI) tool powered by ChatGPT, crafted to offer a comprehensive yet succinct overview
of your file system. Leveraging advanced directory analysis, Raggle generates hidden folders containing brief summaries
of each file, taking advantage of ChatGPT's unparalleled natural language processing capabilities. An aggregated summary
of all contents can be accessed at the root directory.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Summaries**: Creates precise summaries for individual files and directories. For text-based files, ChatGPT
   assists in condensing information while preserving its primary essence.
2. **Natural Language Interaction**: Raggle allows users to engage in a human-like conversation. Instead of following
   strict command patterns, users can make requests like "Can you describe this directory?" or "Briefly summarize this
   file."
3. **Comprehensive Overview**: At the top-level directory, users can fetch an all-inclusive summary of every piece of
   content.
4. **Intelligent Search Guidance**: Through search queries, Raggle, backed by ChatGPT, directs users toward potential
   directories of interest with insightful suggestions. For example, asking "Where could I find the financial data?"
   might lead to the advice: "You might want to explore the 'Finance' directory."
5. **Interactive Experience**: Raggle offers a dialogue-driven interface, allowing users to naturally interact, refine
   searches, pose follow-up questions, and seek clarifications on generated summaries.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Users can give feedback on the summaries or search recommendations, letting ChatGPT adjust and
   improve its future responses.
7. **Optimized with RAGs and Embeds**: Raggle adeptly interprets and incorporates outputs from RAG models, delivering
   answers that are highly relevant to user queries.

Raggle, harnessing the prowess of ChatGPT, seeks to redefine how users engage with their file systems, turning data
exploration, summarization, and retrieval into an intuitive, conversational experience.
